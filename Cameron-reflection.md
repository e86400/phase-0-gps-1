## Answers to Reflection Questions! 

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
	Prior to the session, I was struggling with the concepts of branches, and understanding exactly how they work with one another. 
* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
	I have a much better understanding of using Github. I feel a lot more comfortable interacting with files on the cloud dashboard.
* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
	We asked for clarification on practical applications for using branches. In other words, we asked our guide to provide an alternative explanation for using branches. 
* **What still confuses you about Git?**
	I'm still a little bit confused as to why something that is merged over from a feature branch back to master, doesn't show up on master when I switch back to to it. I'm wondering if this requires me to update the repo and clone it again. I'm going to read up more on this to makes sure I have a rock-solid foundation on these concepts.
* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
	I really enjoyed this GPS experience. I had a great experience with my peer, and our guide was helpful, but not too invasive. I'm looking forward to other GPS exercises.
