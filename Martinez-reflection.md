## Answers to reflection questions


* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was really struggling on how to correctly work with branches and push/pull them in connection to GitHub. I also wasn't sure when the best time to merge feature and master branches was.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The GPS session helped me in understanding the push/pull aspects of branches in connection with GitHub a little better. 

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked my pair a lot of questions, one in particular was about when the best time to merge was. My pair wasn't sure, so our guide clarified it a bit

* **What still confuses you about Git?**
I think I still need a lot of practice working on branches, merging, pushing changes, pulling fromo GitHub. I understand the basic concepts, but I want to be certain of every command I do so that I don't get confused. 

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Overall it was a positive one. I think my pair and I worked well together and shared confusion in some areas which we asked questions about to try and get them clarified. Our pace was good and the guide helped us when needed.
